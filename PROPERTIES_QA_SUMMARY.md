# Properties Feature - QA & Migration Summary

## ✅ Database Schema & RLS Policies

### Tables Created
All property-related tables are now properly set up with Row-Level Security:

1. **`properties`**
   - Core property data (address, type, status, metadata)
   - RLS: Family members can view/create/update/delete their family's properties
   
2. **`property_documents`**
   - Document storage (deeds, surveys, warranties, etc.)
   - Storage bucket: `property-documents` (private)
   - RLS: Family members can view/create/update/delete documents for their family's properties
   
3. **`property_reminders`**
   - Maintenance and upkeep reminders
   - RLS: Family members can view/create/update/delete reminders for their family's properties
   
4. **`story_property_links`**
   - Links stories to properties
   - RLS: Family members can view/create/delete links for their family
   
5. **`media_property_links`**
   - Links media to properties
   - RLS: Family members can view/create/delete links for their family

### RLS Policy Pattern
All tables follow the same secure access pattern:
```sql
-- Consistent family-based access control
family_id IN (
  SELECT family_id FROM members WHERE profile_id = auth.uid()
)
```

This ensures:
- Users can only access properties in families they belong to
- No cross-family data leakage
- Automatic permission inheritance from family membership

## 🔒 Security Verification

### Storage Policies
The `property-documents` bucket has proper RLS:
- ✅ Family members can view documents in their family folder
- ✅ Family members can upload to their family folder
- ✅ Family members can delete from their family folder
- ✅ Bucket is private (not publicly accessible)

### Linter Results
Security linter shows 8 pre-existing warnings (not related to Properties feature):
- 1 ERROR: Security definer view (pre-existing)
- 6 WARNS: Function search path mutable (pre-existing)
- 1 WARN: Leaked password protection disabled (pre-existing)

**No new security issues introduced by Properties feature.**

## 📊 Data Integrity

### Default Values
- `status` defaults to `'current'` for new properties
- All `created_at`/`updated_at` timestamps auto-populate
- UUIDs auto-generate for all IDs
- Foreign key constraints ensure referential integrity

### Migration Status
✅ All tables created successfully
✅ All RLS policies applied
✅ All triggers configured
✅ Storage bucket and policies created

## 🚀 Performance Considerations

### Indexes
Consider adding these indexes for better performance:
```sql
-- Property lookups by family
CREATE INDEX idx_properties_family_id ON properties(family_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_property_reminders_family_id ON property_reminders(family_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_property_documents_family_id ON property_documents(family_id);

-- Link table queries
CREATE INDEX idx_story_property_links_story_id ON story_property_links(story_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_story_property_links_property_id ON story_property_links(property_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_media_property_links_media_id ON media_property_links(media_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_media_property_links_property_id ON media_property_links(property_id);

-- Reminder due date queries
CREATE INDEX idx_property_reminders_due_at ON property_reminders(due_at) WHERE completed_at IS NULL;

-- Document expiry queries
CREATE INDEX idx_property_documents_expires_at ON property_documents(expires_at) WHERE expires_at IS NOT NULL;
```

### Query Optimization
- All queries use proper JOIN conditions
- React Query provides client-side caching
- Optimistic updates reduce perceived latency

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### ✅ Completed
- [x] Properties CRUD operations
- [x] Document upload/download
- [x] Reminder creation/completion
- [x] RLS policy verification
- [x] Storage bucket access control

### 📝 Recommended Tests
- [ ] Timeline query performance with 1k+ items
- [ ] Bulk property import
- [ ] Document file size limits (20MB)
- [ ] Concurrent reminder updates
- [ ] Property deletion cascade behavior

## 🔄 Integration Status

### ✅ No Regressions Detected
- Stories feature: ✅ Working (link tables in place)
- Media feature: ✅ Working (link tables in place)
- Pets feature: ✅ Unaffected
- Timeline: ✅ Unaffected

### 🔗 Feature Integration Points
1. **Story Composer**: Can tag properties when creating stories
2. **Media Upload**: Can tag properties when uploading media
3. **Timeline**: Property-tagged content appears in feeds
4. **Weekly Digest**: Upcoming reminders included

## 📋 Known Pre-existing Issues
The following database errors are **NOT** related to Properties feature:
1. `invalid input syntax for type uuid` in `story_sources` table
2. `column media.person_id does not exist`

These should be addressed separately.

## 🎯 Acceptance Criteria Met
- ✅ RLS policies inherit family access pattern
- ✅ All tables have proper security
- ✅ Link tables function correctly
- ✅ No regressions in existing features
- ✅ Properties hub is fully functional
- ✅ Document vault operational
- ✅ Upkeep reminders working
- ✅ Address normalization implemented
- ✅ Map thumbnail fallbacks working

## 🚢 Ready for Production
The Properties feature is production-ready with:
- Secure data access (RLS)
- Proper data validation
- Optimistic UI updates
- Error handling
- Loading states
- Empty states
